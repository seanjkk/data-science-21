# Data Normalization and Entity-Relationship Diagramming

The following table, representing students' grades in courses at a university, is already in [first normal form](https://knowledge.kitchen/A_Simple_Guide_to_Five_Normal_Forms_in_Relational_Database_Theory#FIRST_NORMAL_FORM) (1NF) - all records have the same number of fields, and there is only one value per field.

| assignment_id | student_id | due_date | professor | assignment_topic                | classroom | grade | relevant_reading    | professor_email   |

## Assumptions

This data represents information about students' grades in courses at a university. The dependencies reflect the reality of how courses work in most universities.

- each course can be taught by multiple professors in different sections
- each professor might teach multiple sections of the same course
- each section meets in a specific classroom with a specific professor
- professors give assignments, with specific due dates
- a professor might give the same assignment to different sections of the same course, but with different due dates
- professors give readings to help with the assignments
- students complete assignments and receive a grade

Further assumptions:

- Assume there are many rows of data following this structure... only 5 sample rows have been showed for brevity. The number of rows is not important to this assignment.
- Assume the `relevant_reading` is relevant to a given assignment.

## Requirements

### Convert to 4NF

Convert this table to the [fourth normal form](https://knowledge.kitchen/A_Simple_Guide_to_Five_Normal_Forms_in_Relational_Database_Theory#Fourth_Normal_Form) (4NF) using the techniques we have learned in this class.
